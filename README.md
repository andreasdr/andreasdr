Hi,

I am a passionate software developer with about 15 years of professional career and lots of additional years doing hobby/private software development stuff.

I already professionally worked in the areas of content management systems, knowledge management systems, financial services, insurance services, e-commerce, computer games, mobile applications and more.

Currently I am working as freelancer, so feel free to send me an email, if you like to have a collaboration.

Here nowadays I am mostly into game development plus game development eco systems that allow to create platform independent games as I was from the beginning an (open source) operating system enthusiast - I love them, I like to support them.
So most of the time I am developing the [TDME2](https://github.com/andreasdr/tdme2) 3D engine, which aims to be platform independant and lightweight, but still pretty complete.

I also develop and maintain our
- C++ transpilable, easy to use, scripting language called [MinitScript](https://github.com/andreasdr/minitscript)
- C++ based graphical user interface for games named [A-GUI](https://github.com/andreasdr/a-gui)
- C++ network library for games [Yannet](https://github.com/andreasdr/yannet)
