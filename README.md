Hi,

I am a passionate software developer with about 15 years of professional career and lots of additional years doing hobby/private software development stuff.

I already professionally worked in the areas of content management systems, knowledge management systems, financial services, insurance services, e-commerce, computer games, mobile applications and more.

Currently I am working as freelancer, so feel free to send me an email, if you like to have a collaboration.

Here nowadays I am mostly into game development plus game development eco systems that allow to create platform independent games as I was from the beginning an (open source) operating system enthusiast - I love them, I like to support them.
So most of the time I am developing the TDME2 3D engine with my mates from Mindty, which aims to be platform independant and lightweight, but still pretty complete.

If you have a interest in my work it might also be interesting to sponsor me.
