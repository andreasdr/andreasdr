Hi,

I am a passionate software developer with about 15 years of professional career and lots of additional years doing hobby/private software development stuff.

I already professionally worked in the areas of content management systems, knowledge management systems, financial services, insurance services, e-commerce, computer games, mobile applications and more.

Currently I am working as freelancer, so feel free to send me an email, if you like to have a collaboration.

Here nowadays I am mostly into game development plus game development eco systems that allow to create platform independent games as I was from the beginning an (open source) operating system enthusiast - I love them, I like to support them.
So most of the time I am developing the C++ based [TDME2](https://github.com/andreasdr/tdme2) 3D engine, which aims to be platform independant and lightweight, but still pretty complete.

I also develop and maintain our
- C++ transpilable, easy to use, scripting language called [MinitScript](https://github.com/andreasdr/minitscript)
- C++ based graphical user interface, originally for games, named [A-GUI](https://github.com/andreasdr/a-gui)
- C++ network library, originally for games, named [Yannet](https://github.com/andreasdr/yannet)

I plan to
- extract and release a JSON validator from [BBT](https://github.com/andreasdr/bbt) that is able to validate the JSON's (sub) data primitives(int, float, bool, string), array and dictionary data types by a textual definition in a separate repository 
- extract and release [TDME2](https://github.com/andreasdr/tdme2) installer as a own product in a separate repository
- develop a artifical intelligence that is able to understand and produce language, which is able to do information processing and storage, so it can talk about a (game's) world, in terms of questions and answers, and such, it will be named "Talkative", its main purpose will be communication between nonplayer characters and nonplayer characters(where a player character can listen to), as well as nonplayer characters and player characters
- develop a kind of "artifical intelligence" that is able to produce music in response to (perception) signals, it will be called "LiveMusic" 
- develop a UDP based browser using [Yannet](https://github.com/andreasdr/yannet), [A-GUI](https://github.com/andreasdr/a-gui) and [MinitScript](https://github.com/andreasdr/minitscript)
- extract some sort of (mini) Electron from [TDME2](https://github.com/andreasdr/tdme2), so this could also be interesting in future as with [TDME2](https://github.com/andreasdr/tdme2) (mini) Electron you could easily create stunning UI desktop/mobile applications even by using a adapted code and WYSIWYG UI editor, ...
